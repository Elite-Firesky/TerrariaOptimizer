TerrariaOptimizer — honest performance helper for modded Terraria.

What it actually does:
- NPC AI throttling: when active NPCs exceed a threshold, non‑town NPCs update every 5 frames.
- Projectile capping: trims oldest, low‑priority projectiles; preserves player, friendly/minion, high‑damage, and near‑player ones.
- Particle reduction: culls dust and gore under stress based on simple indicators.
- Optional rain optimization: conservatively deactivates far‑away rain droplets under stress while keeping all rain within the camera view (zoom‑aware, buffered).
- Lighting culling: skips far‑offscreen light from projectiles and dust.
- Decorative tiles: freezes some tile animations on skip frames during fast movement.
- Texture tracking: lightweight LRU markers; does not block texture loads.
- Offscreen helper: interval updates for far entities used by other systems.
- Memory monitor: forces GC only past a hard threshold; can clear pools.
- Object pools: common collections to reduce temporary allocations.
- Multiplayer: server‑side throttling by interval/distance; client always allowed to send.
- Networking fast path: caches player centers per tick and uses squared distance checks; offscreen flags use compact arrays for faster decisions.
- Multi‑core (optional): when enabled, precomputes projectile trim candidates and server offscreen flags off‑thread, applying results on the main thread.

Configuration:
- Each system is togglable with thresholds. Safe defaults, minimal risk.
